It is the first thing that brought the threads(thread support) into the picture in better way.

Basically Future is an objects which wraps the result of an asynchronous operation. We can use it by leveraging the threadpool

In Future Inteface we cannot use the threads which are executed firstly, we cannot treat them as collection and which breaches the code of non blocking. As a result the result of any other thread is blocked if the current thread is working and the statement to use the result of previous thread is written below it.
