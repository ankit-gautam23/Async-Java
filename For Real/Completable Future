CompletableFuture is a class which implements the Future interface.

Like in Future threadPool.submit method which takes the runnable and returns the Future of type wildcard.
In CompletableFuture we have runasync method which takes a runnable and returns CompletableFuture of void type

In CompletableFuture we can say ke it uses common pool for executing the threads and we can explicitily change the number of threads the common pool can have 
or else, it will create one thread per task.

we can use threadpool to execute other runnable using the runAsync method with an executor added to it.
